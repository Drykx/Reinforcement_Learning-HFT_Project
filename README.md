# RL in Limit Order Book for Cryptocurrency Trading

## Introduction

In the course Reinforcement Learning `EE-568` at EPFL, under the supervision of Yves Rechner and Philipp J. Schneider, we trained trading agents with **PPO** and **StableBaselines3** based on [mbt_gym](https://github.com/JJJerome/mbt_gym) module, a suite of gymnasium environment who aims to solve model-based HFT problems such as market-making and optimal execution.
