# RL in Limit Order Book for Cryptocurrency Trading

## Introduction

In the course Reinforcement Learning `EE-568` at EPFL, under the supervision of Yves Rechner and Philipp J. Schneider, we trained trading agents with **PPO** and **StableBaselines3** based on [mbt_gym](https://github.com/JJJerome/mbt_gym) module, a suite of gymnasium environment who aims to solve model-based HFT problems such as market-making and optimal execution.

You can find our modification of the [mbt_gym](mbty_gym) module with the main input being the [vizualisation methods](mbt_gym/gym/helpers/helper2.py) and the new functions in certain files to implement the backtest; here is an example of our [Jupyter Notebooks](CleanExample.ipynb). 

The [Report](src/Project.pdf) and the [Poster](src/Poster.pdf) are in the source folder.
