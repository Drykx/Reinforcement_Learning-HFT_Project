# Reinforcement Learning in Limit Order Book for Cryptocurrency Trading

## Introduction

In the course Reinforcement Learning `EE-568` at EPFL, we worked under the supervision of Yves Rechner and Philipp J. Schneider 


For the final work of `MATH-414`, we picked the project: [Stochastic approximation in mathematical finance](Docs/stochastic_approximation.pdf). We were asked to answer the questions and deliver a report accompanied by an oral presentation.
### Github organization
In the [Source](Source) folder, you can find the [Jupyter Notebook](Source/Project.qmd) as well as two module .py files [European functions](Source/European_Functions.py) and [Asian functions](Source/Asian_Functions.py). And you can find the final report and the presentation [here](Docs/Project.pdf) and [here](Docs/Presentation.pdf).
### Improvement 
The final report needs improvement, more precisely, in the clarity of the text and the overall presentation. Additionally, the clarity of the Jupyter notebook could be improved by discarding some unnecessary sections and annotating the code.
